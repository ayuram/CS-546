      "\n",
      "## Answer 1\n",
      "## Step 1: Understand the concept of base conversion\n",
      "To solve this problem, we need to convert the base-10 integers 300 and 1800 into base 3 and then compare the number of digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Convert 300 to base 3\n",
      "We start by finding the largest power of 3 that is less than or equal to 300. This is $3^4 = 81$. The largest multiple of 81 that is less than 300 is $3 \\cdot 81 = 243$. Then we subtract this from 300, leaving us with $300 - 243 = 57$. We repeat this process for 57, finding the largest multiple of a power of 3 less than 57, which is $2 \\cdot 3^3 = 54$. We subtract this from 57, leaving us with $57 - 54 = 3$. Since $3 = 1 \\cdot 3^1$, we can express 300 in base 3 as $102100_3$.\n",

      "Similarly, we find the largest power of 3 less than or equal to 1800, which is $3^6 = 729$. The largest multiple of 729 that is less than 1800 is $2 \\cdot 729 = 1458$. Then we subtract this from 1800, leaving us with $1800 - 1458 = 342$. We repeat the process for 342, finding the largest multiple of a power of 3 less than 342, which is $4 \\cdot 3^4 = 324$. We subtract this from 342, leaving us with $342 - 324 = 18$. Since $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, we can express 1800 in base 3 as $210210_3$ but we need to continue the process to ensure we have the complete base 3 representation. However, we can already see that 1800 will have more digits than 300 in base 3.\n",

      "## Step 4: Count the digits of each base 3 number\n",

      "To find the area of quadrilateral $MNPO$, we can use the properties of midpoints and the formula for the area of a trapezoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 1: Identify the midpoints and their properties\n",
      "The midpoints of $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are $E$ and $F$, respectively. Also, $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{FD}$, respectively.\n",

      "## Step 2: Determine the lengths of the bases of trapezoid $ABCD$\n",

      "## Step 3: Find the length of the base of quadrilateral $MNPO$\n",
      "Since $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{FD}$, respectively, the length of the base of quadrilateral $MNPO$ is half the length of the base of trapezoid $ABCD$, which is $4/2 = 2$.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Find the height of quadrilateral $MNPO$\n",
      "The height of quadrilateral $MNPO$ is the same as the height of trapezoid $ABCD$, which is the distance between the parallel bases.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Find the area of quadrilateral $MNPO$\n",
      "Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we can find the area of quadrilateral $MNPO$.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact height of the trapezoid $ABCD$, but we can observe that quadrilateral $MNPO$ is a trapezoid with half the height of trapezoid $ABCD$. Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{FD}$, respectively, and $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$, respectively, we can see that $MNPO$ is a trapezoid with half the height of trapezoid $ABCD$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we can see that the bases of trapezoid $MNPO$ are half the length of the bases of trapezoid $ABCD$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $MNPO$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the area of trapezoid $ABCD$. However, we cannot find the exact area without more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if we consider that trapezoid $ABCD$ has height $2$ (the distance between the parallel bases), we can calculate the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6: Calculate the area of trapezoid $ABCD$\n",
      "Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we have\n",

How many different sequences of 15 coin tosses will contain exactly two HH, three HT, four TH, and five TT subsequences?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Answer 1\n",
      "To solve this problem, we need to consider how the different subsequences (HH, HT, TH, TT) can be arranged to form a sequence of 15 coin tosses.\n",

      "There are a total of 12 marbles in the bag, and we draw 3 marbles without replacement. The total number of ways to draw 3 marbles out of 12 is given by the combination formula:\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, let's find the number of ways to draw 3 marbles such that at least one of them is blue. We can find this by subtracting the number of ways to draw 3 red marbles from the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles.\n",

      "We see that $x = 3$ is a solution, and we want to show that it is the only one. Note that $3^x$ grows faster than $2x$, so the left side is increasing for $x > 0$.\n",
