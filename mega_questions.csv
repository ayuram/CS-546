## Question 2
Benjamin has 24 pencils. He lost a quarter of the pencils, and he still had a third as many pencils as Olivia. How many pencils does Olivia have?

## Answer 2
Let's break it down:

Benjamin has 24 pencils initially. He lost a quarter of them, which is 24 / 4 = 6 pencils.

So, he has 24 - 6 = 18 pencils left.

It's given that he has a third as many pencils as Olivia. Let's denote the number of pencils Olivia has as x.

Then, we can set up the equation: 18 = x / 3

To find x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 18 * 3

x = 54

So, Olivia has 54 pencils.

Answer: \boxed{54}

Simplify $(3a + b)(a + 2b) - (a + b)^2$.

## Answer 1
Expand $(3a + b)(a + 2b)$:
\[ (3a + b)(a + 2b) = 3a(a + 2b) + b(a + 2b) = 3a^2 + 6ab + ab + 2b^2 = 3a^2 + 7ab + 2b^2 \]

Expand $(a + b)^2$:
\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \]

Now subtract $(a + b)^2$ from $(3a + b)(a + 2b)$:
\[ (3a^2 + 7ab + 2b^2) - (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 3a^2 + 7ab + 2b^2 - a^2 - 2ab - b^2 = 2a^2 + 5ab + b^2 \]

The final simplified expression is:

In a rectangular prism, the length of the base is $x$ cm, the width of the base is $2x$ cm, and the height is $5x$ cm. The prism is then stretched to form a cube with the same volume as the original prism. What is the ratio of the volume of the original prism to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction.

## Answer 2
The volume of the original rectangular prism is
\[ V_{\text{prism}} = x \times 2x \times 5x = 10x^3 \]

The volume of the cube is
\[ V_{\text{cube}} = a^3 \]
where $a$ is the side length of the cube.

Since the cube has the same volume as the original prism,
\[ V_{\text{cube}} = V_{\text{prism}} \Rightarrow a^3 = 10x^3 \Rightarrow a = \sqrt[3]{10x^3} = \sqrt[3]{10}x \]

The ratio of the volume of the original prism to the volume of the cube is
\[ \frac{V_{\text{prism}}}{V_{\text{cube}}} = \frac{10x^3}{(\sqrt[3]{10}x)^3} = \frac{10x^3}{10x^3} = \boxed{1} \]

## Question 2
In quadrilateral $ABCD$, $\angle B$ is a right angle, diagonal $\overline{AC}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{CD}$, $AB=18$, $BC=21$, and $CD=14$. Find the perimeter of triangle $ADC$.

## Answer 2
To find the perimeter of triangle $ADC$, we need to determine the lengths of sides $AD$, $AC$, and $CD$. We're given $CD=14$.

1. Find the length of diagonal $AC$ using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle $ABC$:
\[ AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \Rightarrow AC^2 = 18^2 + 21^2 \Rightarrow AC^2 = 324 + 441 \Rightarrow AC^2 = 765 \Rightarrow AC = \sqrt{765} \]

2. Since diagonal $\overline{AC}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{CD}$, triangle $ACD$ is a right triangle. Apply the Pythagorean theorem again to find $AD$:
\[ AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 \Rightarrow AD^2 = 765 + 14^2 \Rightarrow AD^2 = 765 + 196 \Rightarrow AD^2 = 961 \Rightarrow AD = \sqrt{961} \Rightarrow AD = 31 \]

Now we have all the lengths needed to calculate the perimeter of triangle $ADC$:
\[ \text{Perimeter of } ADC = AD + AC + CD = 31 + \sqrt{765} + 14 \]

To simplify $\sqrt{765}$, look for perfect square factors:
\[ \sqrt{765} = \sqrt{9 \times 85} = 3\sqrt{85} \]

Substitute back into the perimeter equation:
\[ \text{Perimeter of } ADC = 31 + 3\sqrt{85} + 14 = 45 + 3\sqrt{85} \]

Thus, the perimeter of triangle $ADC$ is:
\[ \boxed{45 + 3\sqrt{85}} \]
45 + 3\sqrt{85}"

Emily spent 48 dollars on pens. She bought a total of 15 pens. She bought 4 black pens at 3 dollars each, 5 red pens at 2 dollars each, and the rest were blue pens. How much does each blue pen cost?

## Answer 2
Let's denote the number of blue pens as $x$ and the cost of each blue pen as $y$.
Since Emily bought a total of 15 pens and 4 of them were black and 5 of them were red, we can conclude that she bought $x = 15 - 4 - 5 = 11 - 5 = 6$ blue pens.
Emily spent a total of 48 dollars.
The cost of black pens is $4 * 3 = 12$ dollars.
The cost of red pens is $5 * 2 = 10$ dollars.
So the cost of blue pens is $48 - 12 - 10 = 36 - 10 = 26$ dollars.
Since Emily bought 6 blue pens, each blue pen costs $26 / 6 = 4.33$ dollars.
Thus, each blue pen costs \boxed{4.33} dollars.

Let $h(x)$ be a function that satisfies $h(h(x)) = x + 1$ for all $x > 0.$ Given that $h(3) = 7,$ find the value of $h(10).$

## Answer 2
Let's use the given functional equation $h(h(x)) = x + 1$ and the fact that $h(3) = 7$ to find the value of $h(10)$.

Since $h(3) = 7$, we can substitute $x = 3$ into the functional equation to get:
\[ h(h(3)) = h(7) = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Now, we have $h(7) = 4$. Substitute $x = 7$ into the functional equation:
\[ h(h(7)) = h(4) = 7 + 1 = 8 \]

Next, we have $h(4) = 8$. Substitute $x = 4$ into the functional equation:
\[ h(h(4)) = h(8) = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Then, we have $h(8) = 5$. Substitute $x = 8$ into the functional equation:
\[ h(h(8)) = h(5) = 8 + 1 = 9 \]

After that, we have $h(5) = 9$. Substitute $x = 5$ into the functional equation:
\[ h(h(5)) = h(9) = 5 + 1 = 6 \]

Continuing, we have $h(9) = 6$. Substitute $x = 9$ into the functional equation:
\[ h(h(9)) = h(6) = 9 + 1 = 10 \]

Finally, we have $h(6) = 10$. Substitute $x = 6$ into the functional equation:
\[ h(h(6)) = h(10) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]

At the zoo, there are three times as many monkeys as lions. If there are 15 lions, how many animals are there?

## Answer 1
Let's solve this problem.

We are given that there are 15 lions.
We are also given that there are three times as many monkeys as lions. So, there are $3 * 15 = 45$ monkeys.
The total number of animals is the sum of lions and monkeys. So, the total number of animals is $15 + 45 = 60$.
Thus, there are \boxed{60} animals at the zoo.

Tom fills a 250 pound sandbag 80% full.  But the filling material he is using is 40% heavier than sand.  How much does the bag weigh?

## Answer 1
Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom fills the 250-pound sandbag 80% full, so the amount of sand he would have put in is 250 * 0.8 = 200 pounds.
2. However, the filling material is 40% heavier than sand, so the weight of the material is 200 * 1.4 = 280 pounds.

Therefore, the bag weighs \boxed{280} pounds.

"## Question 1
A square is inscribed in a circle, and a point is chosen at random on the circumference of the circle. What is the probability that the point lies closer to a vertex of the square than to the midpoint of a side?

## Answer 1
A point lies closer to a vertex of the square than to the midpoint of a side if and only if the point lies on one of the four arcs between a vertex and the midpoint of a side.

The circle can be divided into 8 equal arcs, each with measure 45°. 4 of these arcs are between a vertex and the midpoint of a side.

The probability that the point lies closer to a vertex of the square than to the midpoint of a side is the length of the 4 arcs divided by the length of the entire circle.

The length of the 4 arcs is $\frac{4}{8} \cdot 2 \pi r = \pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.

The length of the entire circle is $2 \pi r$.

So, the probability is $\frac{\pi r}{2 \pi r} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

"## Question 1
In an isosceles right triangle with legs of length 6, a circle is inscribed such that it touches the hypotenuse and both legs. What is the maximum possible area of a square inscribed in this circle?

## Answer 1
Since the triangle is isosceles and right, both legs are the same length and the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg.

Let's find the radius of the inscribed circle.

The area of the right triangle is
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2}(6)(6) = 18 \]

For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, the inradius ($r$) can be found using the formula:
\[ A = r \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]

We know the area $A = 18$, and the lengths of the sides are $6$, $6$, and $6\sqrt{2}$.

Rearrange the formula to solve for $r$:
\[ r = \frac{2A}{a + b + c} = \frac{2(18)}{6 + 6 + 6\sqrt{2}} = \frac{36}{12 + 6\sqrt{2}} \]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ r = \frac{36}{12 + 6\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{12 - 6\sqrt{2}}{12 - 6\sqrt{2}} = \frac{36(12 - 6\sqrt{2})}{(12 + 6\sqrt{2})(12 - 6\sqrt{2})} \]

\[ r = \frac{432 - 216\sqrt{2}}{144 - 72} = \frac{432 - 216\sqrt{2}}{72} = 6 - 3\sqrt{2} \]

The diameter of the inscribed circle is $2r$, so the side length of the square inscribed in this circle is $\frac{2r}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}r$.

The area of the square is $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side:
\[ s^2 = (\sqrt{2}r)^2 = 2r^2 = 2(6 - 3\sqrt{2})^2 \]

\[ s^2 = 2(36 - 36\sqrt{2} + 18) = 2(54 - 36\sqrt{2}) = 108 - 72\sqrt{2} \]

Thus, the maximum possible area of the square is:
\[ \boxed{108 - 72\sqrt{2}} \]
108 - 72\sqrt{2}

A factory has a machine that produces wooden pencils. When the machine is first started, it takes 8 minutes to produce each pencil due to the time it takes to warm up. After the first hour, once the machine has reached optimal temperature, it takes only 6 minutes to produce each pencil. How many more pencils are produced in the last hour of the day compared to the first?

## Answer 1
In the first hour, it takes 8 minutes to produce a pencil. So the number of pencils produced is 60 / 8 = 7.5 pencils. Since we can't produce half a pencil, this amounts to 7 pencils.
In the last hour, it takes 6 minutes to produce a pencil. So the number of pencils produced is 60 / 6 = 10 pencils.
The difference in the number of pencils produced in the last hour compared to the first hour is 10 - 7 = 3.
Thus, 3 more pencils are produced in the last hour of the day compared to the first hour.
So the answer is \boxed{3}.

If two distinct members of the set $\{ 2, 4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 50 \}$ are randomly selected and multiplied, what is the probability that the product is a multiple of 100? Express your answer as a common fraction.

## Answer 2
There are 7 numbers in the set, so there are $\binom{7}{2} = \frac{7!}{(7 - 2)!2!} = \frac{7!}{5!2!} = 21$ possible pairs.

To obtain a product that is a multiple of 100, at least one of the factors must have at least 2 factors of 2 and at least one factor of 5.

We can list all pairs $(x,y)$ for which $xy$ is a multiple of 100:
\[ (10, 20), (20, 10), (20, 50), (50, 20), (10, 50), (50, 10), (4, 50), (50, 4), (4, 25) \text{ and } (12, 50), (50, 12), (20, 15) \text{ and } (20, 15) \]

There are 7 numbers in this set, so there are $\binom{7}{2} = \frac{7!}{(7 - 2)!2!} = \frac{7!}{5!2!} = 21$ possible pairs. Hence there are $\frac{7}{21}$ ways in which we can form such a pair.

## Question 2
Find the largest positive integer $x$ such that $x^2$ is relatively prime to $30!$.

## Answer 2
First, we need to find the prime factorization of $30!$ and identify the primes that divide it.

The prime factorization of $30!$ is
\[ 30! = 2^{26} \cdot 3^{13} \cdot 5^7 \cdot 7^4 \cdot 11^2 \cdot 13^2 \cdot 17 \cdot 19 \cdot 23 \cdot 29 \]

Any integer $x$ that shares a prime factor with $30!$ will have an $x^2$ that is not relatively prime to $30!$. Therefore, we need to find the largest positive integer $x$ that does not share any prime factors with $30!$.

From the prime factorization, we can see that all prime numbers less than or equal to $29$ are factors of $30!$. This means that any integer $x$ greater than $29$ will have a prime factor that divides $30!$.

The largest positive integer $x$ that does not share any prime factors with $30!$ is the largest prime number less than $30$, which is $29$.

Therefore, the largest positive integer $x$ such that $x^2$ is relatively prime to $30!$ is:
\[ \boxed{29} \]

"## Question 1
Let $h(4x-1) = 2x + 7$.  For what value of $x$ is $h(x) = x$?

## Answer 1
To find $h(x) = x$, we need to find a general expression for $h(x)$.

Let $u = 4x - 1$, then
\[ x = (u + 1) : 4 \]

Given:
\[ h(u) = 2\frac{(u + 1)}{4} + 7 \]

Simplify the expression for $h(u)$:
\[ h(u) = \frac{2u + 2}{4} + 7 = \frac{u + 1}{2} + 7 \]

To find where $h(x) = x$:
\[ x = \frac{x + 1}{2} + 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x = x + 1 + 14 \Rightarrow x = 15 \]

\[ x = \boxed{15} \]

"## Question 1
Consider the sequence $a_n = 1 + \frac{2}{1 + \frac{2}{1 + \frac{2}{1 + \cdots}}}$, where the sequence terminates after $n$ nested fractions. Prove that the sequence $a_n$ converges and find its limit.

## Answer 1
Let's analyze the sequence $a_n$ and try to find a pattern.

We have:
   \begin{align*}
   a_1 &= 1 + 2 = 3 \\
   a_2 &= 1 + \frac{2}{1 + 2} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \\
   a_3 &= 1 + \frac{2}{1 + \frac{2}{1 + 2}} = 1 + \frac{2}{\frac{5}{3}} = 1 + \frac{6}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \\
   a_4 &= 1 + \frac{2}{1 + \frac{2}{1 + \frac{2}{1 + 2}}} = 1 + \frac{2}{\frac{11}{5}} = 1 + \frac{10}{11} = \frac{21}{11}
   \end{align*}

We can see that the denominators of $a_n$ are the numerators of $a_{n-1}$.

Notice that:
   \begin{align*}
   a_2 &= 1 + \frac{2}{a_1} \\
   a_3 &= 1 + \frac{2}{a_2} \\
   a_4 &= 1 + \frac{2}{a_3} \\
   \vdots \\
   a_n &= 1 + \frac{2}{a_{n-1}}
   \end{align*}

Assuming the sequence converges to a limit $L$, we have:
\[ L = 1 + \frac{2}{L} \Rightarrow L^2 - L - 2 = 0 \Rightarrow (L + 1)(L - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us two possible values for $L$: $L = -1$ or $L = 2$.

Since the sequence $a_n$ is positive for all $n$, the limit $L$ must also be positive. Therefore, $L = 2$.

So, the sequence $a_n$ converges to $\boxed{2}$.

## Question 2
Find the sum of the real roots of the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^3-2x^2-5x+3} = x-1$.

## Answer 2
First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ \sqrt[3]{x^3-2x^2-5x+3} = x-1 \]

Take both sides to the power of 3 to eliminate the cube root:
\[ (\sqrt[3]{x^3-2x^2-5x+3})^3 = (x-1)^3 \]

\[ x^3-2x^2-5x+3 = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ -2x^2 - 5x + 3 = -3x^2 + 3x - 1 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x^2 - 8x + 4 = 0 \]

Now we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

\[ x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)} \]

\[ x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 16}}{2} \]

\[ x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{48}}{2} \]

\[ x = \frac{8 \pm 4\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

\[ x = 4 \pm 2\sqrt{3} \]

So the roots of the equation are $4 + 2\sqrt{3}$ and $4 - 2\sqrt{3}$. The sum of these roots is:
\[ (4 + 2\sqrt{3}) + (4 - 2\sqrt{3}) = 8 \]

Therefore, the sum of the real roots of the equation is $\boxed{8}$.

## Question 2
If $3x-5=10x+9$, what is $4(x+7)$?

## Answer 2
We can solve the given equation for $x$ by isolating $x$ on one side:
\[ 3x - 5 = 10x + 9 \Rightarrow 3x - 10x = 5 + 9 \Rightarrow -7x = 14 \Rightarrow x = -2 \]

To find $4(x+7)$, we substitute $x=-2$ into the expression and evaluate:
\[ 4(x+7) = 4((-2)+7) = 4(5) = 20 \]

So the answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]

[/asy]

## Answer 1
## Step 1:  To find the ratio of the area of quadrilateral $PUVQ$ to the area of quadrilateral $UVRS$, we need to analyze the given figure and understand its properties.
## Step 2:  We observe that five congruent right triangles are arranged to form quadrilateral $PQRS$, and points $U$ and $V$ are midpoints of $PR$ and $QS$, respectively.
## Step 3:  The given figure suggests that $PQ=RS$ and $QR=PS$, implying that $PQRS$ is a parallelogram. Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, we can conclude that $PQRS$ is a parallelogram.
## Step 4:  We also notice that $\triangle PUV$ and $\triangle QRV$ are congruent due to the properties of the midpoints of the sides of a parallelogram. Similarly, $\triangle VUS$ and $\triangle QUT$ are congruent.
## Step 5:  Additionally, we can prove that $\triangle PUV$ is congruent to $\triangle QRV$ and $\triangle VUS$ is congruent to $\triangle QUT$ by the SAS Congruence Theorem.
## Step 6:  Now, to find the ratio of the areas, we need to consider the areas of these triangles. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.
## Step 7:  By comparing the areas of the triangles, we can conclude that the area of quadrilateral $PUVQ$ is equal to the area of quadrilateral $UVRS$ plus the area of $\triangle QUT$.
## Step 8:  Since the area of quadrilateral $UVRS$ is equal to the area of $\triangle QRV$ plus the area of $\triangle VUS$, and the area of quadrilateral $PUVQ$ is equal to the area of quadrilateral $UVRS$ plus the area of $\triangle QUT$, we can express the ratio of the areas as $\frac{2\triangle QRV + \triangle QUT}{2\triangle QRV}$.
## Step 9:  Further simplifying this expression, we get $\frac{2+1}{2}=\frac{3}{2}$, which represents the ratio of the areas of quadrilateral $PUVQ$ to quadrilateral $UVRS$.
## Step 10:  Therefore, the sum of the ratio is $3+2=5$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$

## Question 2
At Frank's Fruit Market, 3 bananas cost as much as 2 apples, and 6 apples cost as much as 4 oranges.  How many oranges cost as much as 18 bananas?

## Answer 2
The problem states that 3 bananas cost as much as 2 apples, so we can say
\[ 3b = 2a \Rightarrow a = \frac{3}{2}b \quad \text{(1)} \]

and 6 apples cost as much as 4 oranges, so
\[ 6a = 4o \Rightarrow o = \frac{6}{4}a \Rightarrow o = \frac{3}{2}a \quad \text{(2)} \]

Using (1) and (2), we get:
\[ o = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{3}{2}b \Rightarrow o = \frac{9}{4}b \Rightarrow 4o = 9b \]

We need to find how many oranges cost as much as 18 bananas. Let's use the ratio:
\[ \frac{4o}{9b} = \frac{x}{18b} \]

\[ 4 \times 18 = 9x \Rightarrow x = \frac{72}{9} \Rightarrow x = \boxed{8} \]

The slant height of a cone is 17 cm, and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 15 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone? Express your answer in terms of π.

## Answer 2
Let's denote the radius of the cone's base as $r$.

The slant height of the cone is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the height of the cone and the radius of the base. Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $r$:
\[ r^2 + 15^2 = 17^2 \Rightarrow r^2 + 225 = 289 \Rightarrow r^2 = 64 \Rightarrow r = 8 \]

Now, the volume of the cone can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (8)^2 (15) = \frac{1}{3} \pi 64 \cdot 15 = \frac{1}{3} \pi 960 = \boxed{320 \pi} \]

"## Question 1
A bakery sells two types of cakes: chocolate and vanilla. A chocolate cake weighs 10% more than a vanilla cake, and when 2/3 of a chocolate cake is consumed, it weighs 450 grams less than when 1/3 of a vanilla cake is consumed. What is the weight of a whole vanilla cake?

## Answer 1
Let's denote the weight of a whole vanilla cake as $V$ grams.

Since a chocolate cake weighs 10% more than a vanilla cake, the weight of a whole chocolate cake is $1.1V$ grams.

When 2/3 of a chocolate cake is consumed, the remaining weight is $1/3$ of the original weight of the chocolate cake, which is $1/3 \cdot 1.1V = 0.3667V$ grams.

When 1/3 of a vanilla cake is consumed, the remaining weight is $2/3$ of the original weight of the vanilla cake, which is $2/3 \cdot V = 0.6667V$ grams.

According to the problem, when 2/3 of a chocolate cake is consumed, it weighs 450 grams less than when 1/3 of a vanilla cake is consumed. This means that the difference between the remaining weights of the two cakes is 450 grams.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.6667V - 0.3667V = 450 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 0.3V = 450 \]

Dividing both sides by 0.3, we get:
\[ V = 450 : 0.3 \Rightarrow V = 1500 \]

Therefore, the weight of a whole vanilla cake is 1500 grams.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1500} \]
1500

## Answer 2
The sum of the interior angles in a quadrilateral is always 360°. We are given three of the angles and need to find the fourth one.

Let's denote the unknown angle as $x$. Then we have:
\[ x + 80 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

Solving for $x$:
\[ x + 290 = 360 \Rightarrow x = 70 \]

So, the smallest interior angle is 70°.
